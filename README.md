### Project Summary:
This is a script that opens the rickroll link as many times as possible, a.k.a until chrome nukes your PC's RAM and it inevitably crashes

<br />

### How does it work?
It's quite simple. It uses threading to repeat the process of openeing the link. Threading is a LOT faster than using loops, so it can open more tabs while giving the victim as less time as possible to react.

<br />

### But... Why?
This was just a small project which was made as a prank(no one actually fell for it but anyway...). I just decided to open source it in case anyone knows how to come up with a better executed prank using this concept, or just wanted to test how threading can be used for similar projects.

<br />

### Disclaimer:
While this is just supposed to be a funny prank, and doesn't cause any damage to the victim's PC, don't use this concept to do anything malicious. I am not responsible for anything that may happen because of that.
